                Researchers have predicted that “vulnerable road users” (VRUs) such as pedestrians will feel less vulnerable and thus take more risks around autonomous vehicles (AVs) than around humanoperated vehicles (HOVs). However, data on the behaviours pedestrians are likely to display during passing as well as crossing interactions with AVs – particularly from naturalistic studies –are currently lacking. Such data could help inform AV system designers and authorities, as well as researchers. So, a novel study was conducted in London, UK. Perceived vulnerability was gauged via a survey on hypothetical pedestrian-vehicle interactions (N = 267). Behaviours were observed during real crossing and passing interactions with AV shuttle pods in a shared space (N = 330). While pedestrians were the main focus, joggers and cyclists were also frequenting the observation site and were included in the analysis of passing interactions. The survey results showed that pedestrians were not perceived to be less vulnerable around AVs. Diminishing initial boldness in the crossing interactions, and high yielding in the passing interactions, supported this, demon­ strating that VRUs were not taking undue risks; rather, they appeared to be experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort. Further results showed other VRU behaviours (gap acceptance, inattention, hesitation, changes in speed, explicit communication, a side preference) may be relevant in AV interactions, but not necessarily to the same degree as when around HOVs or not in line with UK road rules. Positive conclusions were drawn for AV programming, and for safety, at least in the short term, but concerns regarding mobility need addressing.

                This letter is the third report from a series of IEEE TIV’s decentralized and hybrid workshops (DHWs) on intelligent vehicles for education (IV4E). Autonomous racing serves as a vital platform for nurturing engineering talents among university students, contributing to the development of skills essential for the intelligent vehicle industry. This letter investigates how recent emerging techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and the Metaverse, can contribute to organizing IV4E-oriented autonomous racing events. Among these DHWs, scholars from diverse fields have collectively explored the integration of LLMs and the Metaverse into autonomous racing for educational purposes. The discussions emphasize the role of Metaverse in creating dynamic and immersive training virtual reality platforms and the role of LLMs in enhancing race commentary and the spectator experience. Within this context, the Metaverse introduces complex scenarios to the racetrack, maintaining suspense about the winning team until a race’s final moment. This dynamic feature excites the race and motivates the participating teams to intensify their competition efforts. LLMs facilitate personalized commentary, inspiring spectators to become future participants in these races. Our DHWs highlighted a future in which technology, autonomy, and education intersect, fostering inclusive, educational, and engaging autonomous racing events.

                Due to the absence of a human driver, the introduction of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) may bring new safety challenges to the traffic system, especially when FAVs interact with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. To ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and FAVs, this questionnaire-based study aims to understand Australian pedestrians’ intention to engage in risky road-crossing behaviors when they interact with FAVs vs. human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A 2 × 2 between-subject design was utilized, in which two risky road-crossing scenarios were designed and took into account the vehicle type (FAV vs. HDV) and vehicle speed (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h). A total of 493 participants (aged 18–77) were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions and completed an online questionnaire based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire measured pedestrians’ intentions to cross the road in the assigned scenarios as well as the motivational factors behind these intentions in terms of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, perceived risk and trust in the vehicle. The results show that pedestrians had significantly higher intentions to cross the road in front of approaching FAVs than HDVs. Participants also reported a lower risk perception of crossing in front of FAVs and greater trust in this type of vehicle. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were significant predictors of intentions to engage in risky road-crossing behavior. Findings of this study provide important implications for the development and implementation of FAVs in the future road transport system.

                Researchers have predicted that “vulnerable road users” (VRUs) such as pedestrians will feel less vulnerable and thus take more risks around autonomous vehicles (AVs) than around humanoperated vehicles (HOVs). However, data on the behaviours pedestrians are likely to display during passing as well as crossing interactions with AVs – particularly from naturalistic studies –are currently lacking. Such data could help inform AV system designers and authorities, as well as researchers. So, a novel study was conducted in London, UK. Perceived vulnerability was gauged via a survey on hypothetical pedestrian-vehicle interactions (N = 267). Behaviours were observed during real crossing and passing interactions with AV shuttle pods in a shared space (N = 330). While pedestrians were the main focus, joggers and cyclists were also frequenting the observation site and were included in the analysis of passing interactions. The survey results showed that pedestrians were not perceived to be less vulnerable around AVs. Diminishing initial boldness in the crossing interactions, and high yielding in the passing interactions, supported this, demon­ strating that VRUs were not taking undue risks; rather, they appeared to be experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort. Further results showed other VRU behaviours (gap acceptance, inattention, hesitation, changes in speed, explicit communication, a side preference) may be relevant in AV interactions, but not necessarily to the same degree as when around HOVs or not in line with UK road rules. Positive conclusions were drawn for AV programming, and for safety, at least in the short term, but concerns regarding mobility need addressing.

                This letter is the third report from a series of IEEE TIV’s decentralized and hybrid workshops (DHWs) on intelligent vehicles for education (IV4E). Autonomous racing serves as a vital platform for nurturing engineering talents among university students, contributing to the development of skills essential for the intelligent vehicle industry. This letter investigates how recent emerging techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and the Metaverse, can contribute to organizing IV4E-oriented autonomous racing events. Among these DHWs, scholars from diverse fields have collectively explored the integration of LLMs and the Metaverse into autonomous racing for educational purposes. The discussions emphasize the role of Metaverse in creating dynamic and immersive training virtual reality platforms and the role of LLMs in enhancing race commentary and the spectator experience. Within this context, the Metaverse introduces complex scenarios to the racetrack, maintaining suspense about the winning team until a race’s final moment. This dynamic feature excites the race and motivates the participating teams to intensify their competition efforts. LLMs facilitate personalized commentary, inspiring spectators to become future participants in these races. Our DHWs highlighted a future in which technology, autonomy, and education intersect, fostering inclusive, educational, and engaging autonomous racing events.

                Due to the absence of a human driver, the introduction of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) may bring new safety challenges to the traffic system, especially when FAVs interact with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. To ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and FAVs, this questionnaire-based study aims to understand Australian pedestrians’ intention to engage in risky road-crossing behaviors when they interact with FAVs vs. human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A 2 × 2 between-subject design was utilized, in which two risky road-crossing scenarios were designed and took into account the vehicle type (FAV vs. HDV) and vehicle speed (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h). A total of 493 participants (aged 18–77) were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions and completed an online questionnaire based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire measured pedestrians’ intentions to cross the road in the assigned scenarios as well as the motivational factors behind these intentions in terms of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, perceived risk and trust in the vehicle. The results show that pedestrians had significantly higher intentions to cross the road in front of approaching FAVs than HDVs. Participants also reported a lower risk perception of crossing in front of FAVs and greater trust in this type of vehicle. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were significant predictors of intentions to engage in risky road-crossing behavior. Findings of this study provide important implications for the development and implementation of FAVs in the future road transport system.
